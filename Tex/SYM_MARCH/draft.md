These models have gain insights of urban features from the interactions, or competitions among cities for new citizens, which respectively lead to urban scaling laws\cite{bettencourt2007growth,court2013origins,batty2019urbanscalinglaw} and Zipf's law, the size distribution of cities\cite{zipf1949human}. Thus, to be a better imitation of cities, these models tend to create high density areas through principles such as the spatial explicit preferential attachment\cite{schweitzer1998estimation}, or resource utilization mechanisms\cite{PhysRevE.90.042815}. For example, multiplicative or correlated percolation\cite{makse1995modelling,PhysRevE.58.7054,rybski2013distance} utility maximizing\cite{axtell2001emergent} models claim to reformulate Zipf's law. In the meantime, the economies of scale, represented by urban scaling laws, are realized through the characterization of human interactions\cite{ccolak2016understanding,louf2014congestion,fujita1976spatial}, such as spatial networks models\cite{marsili1998interacting,court2013origins,Li2017Simple}. These models function in specific spatial scale under certain equilibrium conditions in growth rates or optimization aims\cite{zipf1949human}.
