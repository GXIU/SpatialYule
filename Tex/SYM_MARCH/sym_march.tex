\section{Introduction}

% 研究的是一个什么问题（spatial growth model），这个问题为什么重要？（可以从理论和实践两个角度说，但偏重于理论）
Spatial growth models, a collection of models that derive macroscopic dynamical state from microscopic growth/attachment rules, may be useful to improve our conceptional understanding of urbanization and landscape evolutions~\cite{PhysRevX.4.011008, Li2017Simple, makse1995modelling, rybski2013distance, nanda2017spatial}. These models usually consist only two parts, spatial attachment and identification of cluster. They theoretically investigate how different growth factors contribute to city emergence, and how these dynamics lead to some well-observed scaling law~\cite{bettencourt2007growth,court2013origins,batty2008size,batty2019urbanscalinglaw}, providing alternative predictions for the irreversible urbanization process. The setting of rules brings a possibility for us to identify what contributes the most in urban development~\cite{batty2017urban}. However, few of them have investigate enough about how cities compete over resource and space. In this Letter, we show that competitions introduced by spatial specialization and resource limit can result in vicissitudes of cities and urban shrinkage.

% Rapid urbanization brings emergent complexity to cities, and spatial growth models are essential tools to study its dynamics, due to their complementary nature of replicability and interpretability. Spatial growth models pervade physicists who is interested in urbanization. During recent years, 
% Cities  Models for spatial growth of cities progress our understanding of urbanization and the inner structures of urban communities in many ways~\cite{PhysRevX.4.011008, Li2017Simple, makse1995modelling, rybski2013distance, nanda2017spatial}. Ci These models theoretically investigate how different growth factors contribute to city emergence, providing predictable substitute for the irreversible urbanization process. For example, many of them have shown their effectiveness in explaining observations such as urban scaling laws~\cite{court2013origins}, fractality~\cite{batty1994fractal,batty2007cities}, and city size distributions (i.e., Zipf's law)~\cite{zipf1949human}, making quantitative predictions broadly to urban morphology and spatial structures~\cite{anas1998urban}. 

% 现在的研究做了什么（现在这块写得太宽泛了，其实相关工作很多，也很具体），有哪些不足？这些不足产生的「可能的」原因是什么？


%These models have gain insights of urban features from the interactions, or competitions among cities for new citizens, which respectively lead to urban scaling laws\cite{bettencourt2007growth,court2013origins,batty2019urbanscalinglaw} and Zipf's law, the size distribution of cities\cite{zipf1949human}. Thus, to be a better imitation of cities, these models tend to create high density areas through principles such as the spatial explicit preferential attachment\cite{schweitzer1998estimation}, or resource utilization mechanisms\cite{PhysRevE.90.042815}. For example, multiplicative or correlated percolation\cite{makse1995modelling,PhysRevE.58.7054,rybski2013distance} utility maximizing\cite{axtell2001emergent} models claim to reformulate Zipf's law. In the meantime, the economies of scale, represented by urban scaling laws, are realized through the characterization of human interactions\cite{ccolak2016understanding,louf2014congestion,fujita1976spatial}, such as spatial networks models\cite{marsili1998interacting,court2013origins,Li2017Simple}. These models function in specific spatial scale under certain equilibrium conditions in growth rates or optimization aims\cite{zipf1949human}.

However, urban systems are dynamic, and necessarily out-of-equilibrium with limitations in economical, political, topographical, and goals towards sustainability. These limitations result in declines of some cities that were once prosperous in embracing more innovative pursuits\cite{batty2017urban}. In other words, only cities who keep enough creative parts can avoid falling into vicissitudinary
development as its marginal effect for latter
stage of urbanization\cite{atkinson2012urban, girardin2009quantifying,gomez2018explaining,parris2003characterizing,batty2008size}. In modeling perspective, the present spatial growth models still lack the ability to capture the competition among cities in both space and resource. To address this issue needs a cross-scale consideration of inter- and intra-city formation in growth dynamics, with some sustainable conditions.

% 我们是怎么来解决这个问题的，有哪些重要的贡献。


%These concerns call for a general approach to model the spatial sprawl of emerging cities and their population under sustainable rules, regarding the competitions for space and resource.
Here, we propose an out-of-equilibrium spatial preferential growth model with restrictions on the maximum systematic rate to grow. In some non-spatial context\cite{PhysRevE.55.R3817}, a finite population has been proved to put severe constraints on the patterns of  evolution, which can be specified as urban rank-size distribution. This restriction is proved later to enhance the intensity of competitions, resulting in realistic urban phenomena like dual cities\cite{silverman2018rethinking}, superior switch\cite{gabaix2004evolution}, and urban shrinkage\cite{haase2014conceptualizing}, that cannot be formulated by existing growth models. The spatial aspect of our model takes the idea of diffusion-limited aggregation\cite{makse1995modelling, rybski2013distance, kleinberg2000navigation}, i.e, new comers would settle near those active citizens, to be involved in the economies of scale.

\section{Results}

\subsection{The Spatial Yule Model}
% 我们提出了一个模型，能干什么事儿，有什么好处。
Our model tells how cities emerge, grow, and compete over space. Its dynamics are mainly determined through three quantitative and spatial rules: 1) \textit{Active citizen rule}. During urban growth process, we assume that only 'active' citizens attract new comers to a nearby place in their city, $k$ and $N_i$ are the number of cities and active citizens in the $i$th city, respectively. 2) \textit{Memory kernel rule}. We take $\sum_{i} N_i \le N^*$ ($N^* \gg 1$) as the satiation condition, i.e., when the total population exceeds $N^*$, a new comer would deactivate a random dweller who is previously active. This mechanism keeps only up to $N^*$ active citizens. Therefore we say these $N^*$ people add up to the memory kernel. 3) \emph{Spatial growth rule}. We assume the studied area is an $L\times L$ 2-dimensional continuous space ($L\gg 1$) with grid of cells, %(IN THE BEGINNING, YOU SAID IT'S A continuous space?),
i.e., the locations of citizens are continuous, but the boundaries of cities are discrete on cells. A New city is seeded randomly over the region as a Poisson point process~\cite{miles1970homogeneous}, and survives if its cell is not taken; Every new citizen settles at a constant distance $r\le 1$ and an random angle $\theta$ from its introducer. Once a cell $c$ has held a citizen from the $i$th city, any citizens from another city $j$ ($j\ne i$) cannot introduce new comers on cell $c$. 

To be simplified, 

% A settlement of a new citizen is confirmed as long as it is on a cell previously empty or shares the citizenship. Cities are established randomly over untaken cells; 
% [YOU CAN RE-ORG THE THIRD RULE].


Based on these rules, we can define the model with a two-phase master equation. Specifically, we assume that the probability of a population increase in city $i$ within the time interval $(t,t+dt)$ is $\beta_2N_idt$, where $N_i$ is the current active population of city $i$ and $\beta_2$ is the introduction rate of every active citizen;
%[GIVE THE DEFINITION OF BETA HERE]. 
We also assume that with a small probability proportional to the number of cities, $\beta_1kdt$, where $\beta_1$ is the rate of generating a new city by each existing city. By new city we mean one new kind of citizen. %[UNCLEAR]. 
The master equation can therefore be written as \begin{align}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}N_i(t) =  \delta_{N_i(t)}\cdot k\beta_1+ (1-\delta_{N_i(t)})\cdot N\beta_2, \end{align} for the free growth phase, where urbanization is weakly dependent with empty space and resource $N^*$;
%[WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF FREE GROWTH?], 
and \begin{align}
dN_i(t)/dt = \beta_2 N_i(t) -\delta_{\{\sum N_i = N^*\}}\cdot\notag \\ \left(\beta_1k(t) + (N^*-N_i(t))\beta_2 \right)
% 	\frac{\partial N_i(t)}{\partial t}  = (N^*\beta_2)[\frac{N_i(t)}{N^*}\cdot(1-N_i(t)/(N^*-1))& \notag\\  - (1-N_i(t)/N^*)\cdot (1-N_i(t)/(N^*-1)) ]&
\end{align}
for the resource constraint phase, where the total resource $N^*$ are all taken and new dwellers get resource only through redistribution. 
%[WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF RESOURCE CONSTRAINT PHASE?].

	\caption{\textbf{(a)} Status in the memory kernel at the free growth phase, i.e., the total population is less than $N^*$. Existing citizens introduce new dwellers at the rate $\beta_2$, while each existing city (noted by nodes in different colors) introduces new cities at the rate $\beta_1$. \textbf{(b)} When the memory kernel is fulfilled, every introduction of new city or citizen leads to an ejection of existing active citizen currently included in the memory kernel. \textbf{(c)} The spatial aspect is that, an offspring citizen's placement is at distance $r$ from the ancestral dweller.

	\label{sketchpic}
\end{figure}

Though $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ have their actual meaning of generation speed, the model's dynamics and patterns are only determined by the relative growth rate $\beta:= \beta_2/\beta_1$. This is parallel Yule's settings on modelling the distribution of species per genus~\cite{yule1925ii}.
%[WHY SET BETA? WHAT'S THE MEANING OF BETA], 
So our model could be regarded as a spatial Yule model with constraints (SYM). A sketch for the SYM is shown in Fig. \ref{sketchpic}.

% [THE FOLLOWING PARA IS VERY CONFUSING. IF THIS IS ALSO RULES, YOU SHOULD PLACE THEM IN THE ABOVE PARA. IF THIS IS NOT, YOU SHOULD SPLIT THEM AND INSERT INTO THE PLACE THAT INTRODUCE PARAMETERS.] 
The model's assumptions are simple. First, urban developments are density driven. Literature has suggested that density-driven social ties and interactions comprise an important driver of the economies of scale~\cite{pan2013urban, girardin2009quantifying, batty1992form}. In the SYM, we further assume only the density of attractive population are corresponding to urban developments. Such active part can be recognized as the total employed or productive people. Second, to make an analytic framework, the growth dynamics are set to be homogeneous. The choice of place of new comers are random; And the rate of introduction and emergence is the same for every active citizen and every city. This diffusive setting of sequential settlements is also realistic urban growth~\cite{RevModPhys.87.925}. 
%. Basically, to insure the appearance of free growth phase, the region is naturally assumed to be sufficiently large and active ($L\gg 1$, $N^*\gg 1$, while the impact of a citizen is restrained within the neighborhood($r\le 1$). Secondly, urban developments are density driven. Literature has suggested that density-driven social ties and interactions comprise an important driver of the economies of scale~\cite{pan2013urban, girardin2009quantifying, batty1992form}. In the SYM, we further assume only the density of attractive population are corresponding to urban developments. Such active part can be recognized as the total employed or productive people. Thirdly, to make it analytical, we assume a homogeneous background in two parts: New cities' establishment is a Poisson point process over all untaken cells~\cite{miles1970homogeneous} [THIS POISSON ASSUMPTION SEEMS VERY IMPORTANT, SHOULD IT BE A RULE IN THE VERY BEGINNING?]; And active citizens at different position introduce new comers at the same rate [THIS SEEMS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, SHOULD IT BE A RULE IN THE VERY BEGINNING?]. This diffusive setting of sequential settlements is also realistic urban growth~\cite{RevModPhys.87.925}. 

In the numerical experiments, the truly worth-tuning parameters are three, $\beta$, $r$, and $N^*$. $\beta$ contributes to the Zipf's coefficient and later defined [AS?] turnover rate~\cite{rooney2006structural}; $r$ contributes to the fractality of urban areas and the time to fill the whole space; $N^*$ is the severeness of resource competition. [HOW TO PERFORM THE SIMULATION?]

% 7. 这个模型能推出哪些结论（1，2，3）。这些结论能如何被数据验证。
\subsection{The free growth phase}

SYM predicts the existence of three phases of urban growth: freely growth phase, economic constraint phase, and spatial constraint phase. We focus on the first two phases, which correspond with cities' memory [WHAT'S THE MEANING OF MEMORY, WHERE IS THE THIRD PHASE?]. In the freely growth phase, cities grow desolately, without being controlled by total resource and space. We now describe its two important properties, stately (1) Zipf's law~\cite{gabaix1999zipf's} for rank size distribution of cities' population, and (2) Clark's law for exponential decay of urban density [REF.]. 

The populations of cities typically decay proportionally to the inverse of their ranks~\cite{gabaix1999zipf's}. This is referred as Zipf's law of cities' population sizes, i.e., the populations of cities distribute as a power of ranks, $f_r(r)\sim r^{-(1+\eta)}$ %[THE BETA HERE IS NOT THE BETA IN YOUR MODEL, SO PLEASE USE ANOTHER LETTER]. 
It is obvious that $N_i(t)$, the number of individuals in the system at time $t$, has a geometric distribution~\cite{durrett1999essentials}, $P(N_i(t)=n)=e^{-\beta_1t}(1-\exp(- {\beta_1} t))^{n-1}$, %[THIS FUNCTION IS FROM LITERATURE? RECALL WHAT? RECALL USUALLY REFERS TO SOME ABOVE-MENTIONED THINGS], 
and from the quantitative assumption above, the number of cities will grow exponentially at rate $\beta_1$, %[WHICH IS THE FIRST ASSUMPTION?], 
if we pick a random city, the time since its first appearance waits exponential times with parameter $\beta_1$. Thus the distribution of population of a random city is 
\begin{align}
	f(n)=\frac{\Gamma(1+1/\beta)\Gamma(n)}{\beta\Gamma(n+1+1/\beta)}\approx Cn^{-1-1/\beta}, \ \text{as } n\to\infty,
\end{align}
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the gamma function. This equation implies a Zipf's relationship with $n(\text{rank})\sim {rank}^{-\beta}$. Noticing that $\beta$ takes value from all positive real number in our model, we can derive arbitrary scaling behaviors by switching $\beta$. According to some studies~\cite{PhysRevLett.79.523}, the power law dependence of population frequency is $2.03\pm 0.05$ for the world, indicating that the average relative emerging rate of cities is around $1$. 

Varying $\beta$ leads to the consideration of different sizes of study area. A small (large) $\beta$ means the emergence of cities is fast (slow), corresponding to a large spatial scale. %[HOW ABOUT A LARGER BETA?] 
Thus varying $\beta$ is parallel to  investigate the number of cities in a given regions of the same population. Some urban systems tend to form new cities to have sufficient infrastructures and less diversity of urban output ($\beta > 1$) and some cities may go otherwise ($\beta< 1$). This value is actually a reflection of the intensity of regional concentration. The experiments have confirmed our analytic results for free growth phase in SYM. %[I DON'T UNDERSTAND FROM `IT IS INTERESTING ... IN SYM. WHY THIS VALUE IS A REFECTION?] 
A simulated validation for this result can be reflected in Fig.\ref{Fig2}. Notably, when $\beta$s are large ($>2$), the simulated Zipfian exponents are remarkably larger than their theoretical predictions. This is because the competition for space benefits small %[WHY LARGE SMALL CITIES?]
cities resulted from their higher density of edging cells, which is proved in \textit{SI}. For large $\beta$s, however, of the same rank, the probability of successful emergence of new city decreases due to relatively larger area of existing cities. This exasperates the concentration of active population in large cities.%% [UNCLEAR].

The realistic Zipf's coefficient is reproduced when $\beta\approx 1$. The theoretical predictions of the slopes are $-\beta$, and is well approximated when $\beta$s are small. Larger $\beta$ reduce the chance of latter city's emergence. Thus the spatial aspects of the SYM strengthen inequality. This result confirms that Zipf's law is valid for growing urban systems where all cities share the same rate to grow. From the other master equation we analyze that this observation vanishes if total growing force is finite. \textbf{(b)} The population distribution as a function of distance from a district's center.

\end{figure}

%% Clark
% [WHAT'S THE LOGIC SENTENCE FOR THE FOLLOWING PARA? I.E., WHAT'S THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FOLLOWING TO ABOVE-MENTIONED THINGS?]
SYM also revisits Clark's law in urban studies~\cite{clark1951urban}. In SYM, population density evolves as two-dimensional diffusion within a city\cite{doi:10.1137/0150099}, where we can focus the density's growth on each axis from the oldest citizens of a city. Let $
(d)$ denote the active population density of locations at the distance $d$ from a city's center, and $t_n$ as the time for the $n$'th citizen to generate, we have 
\begin{align}
	\rho_{t_{n+1}}(d) = (\rho_{t_{n}}(d-r) + \rho_{t_{n}}(d+r) )/2.\label{loc_den}  
\end{align} By re-scaling time as $\tau_n = t_n\cdot (k\beta_1+N\beta_2)/T$, for a sufficient large $T$, this equation results in an exponential decay of density
\begin{align}
	\rho(d)\sim e^{-\alpha d}\label{clark_eq}.
\end{align} Details are presented in \textit{SI}. 

A direct implication of Clark's law is that the population density is just a function of city's age and the distance from urban center. Specifically, the density at the edges is important since it determines the competition advantages for space. The population within an edging cell of city $j$ is estimated by $e^{(T-T_j)}\int_{d}^{d+1}\rho(r)dr/(2\pi d)$, where $T_j$ is the emerging time of city $j$. We also have the waiting time $T_{n+1}-T_{n}\sim 1/n$, and the total population approximation $e^{\beta_1+\beta_2}$, combining which we derive the density of edging cells if time and the urban radius are given. Since the attractiveness of large urban center is larger, the edging population of large cities is actually smaller than minor cities. We validate our prediction with simulations in Fig.\@\ref{Fig2}. [DON'T FOLLOW UP THIS PARA, WHY IT HERE, WHY IT IMPORTANT?] %We give a detailed derivation in Appendix B\ref{edge_comp}.
Investigating $r$, we conclude that the metropolis areas over the world have very different densities. In SYM, it determines the sprawl of a city with given population. It can also be taken as the area proportion for a city in the studied region. On the other hand, it is also constraint of regional growth controlling the expected allowance of cities. [DON'T FOLLOW UP THIS PARA, WHY IT HERE, WHY IT IMPORTANT?]

\subsection{The economic constraint phase}

The multi-perspective coincidence between the exponents derived in our model and those in empirical evidences of population studies indicates that only two observation scales lead to the behaviors of regional dynamics. This means that the actual urban growth has not yet reached the constrained cases. However, preventive measures are still necessary. Thus we bring a general constraining parameter $N^*$ to further discuss the second phase of SYM, the economy constraint phase, i.e., the total population reaches $N^*$. Such setting is the abstract of many real-life rules set by global organizations such as the allowance of carbon emissions or sustainable development projects. In each city, a proportion of population are active. Here, $\sum_{i=1} N_i(t) = N^*$ for $t$ that is sufficiently large. If in some period, the minor cities generate more offspring than major ones and the superiority of remaining population within the memory kernel changes, minor city will increase its ranking, as the growing rate for each city $i$ is actually $N_i\beta_2$. As for the dynamics within memory kernel, in each city, $N_i$ acts as a random walk with absorption wall $0$, since no offspring will be expected if no nodes are left in the kernel. This result also works for single cell case within a city. Denote the population with cell $j$ of city $i$ as $m_{ij}$. According to\@\cite{durrett1999essentials}, we use a result for branching process that a cell loses its vitality if the population goes downhill under a threshold \begin{align}\rho_{threshold} = k/\beta.\end{align} This value shall be regarded as the sign for \emph{urban shrinkage}, for the edging cells have lower density according to equation\@\ref{clark_eq} thus have an exponentially higher probability to be languished. In other words, urban shrinkage shall be reasoned by limited systematic resources. 

The kernel mechanism also plays a role at the cross-city scale: The preference of larger cities is easier to fail in a system with the memory kernel. The competition for active citizens in SYM receives more than pure birth settings because the sum of active population is given as $N^*$. In other words, SYM system doesn't consider natural growth. To test this interpretation, we analyze the turnover rate, defined as the average frequency of time steps in a realization that the second largest city surpasses the largest in active population. We conduct numerical experiments, and receive power law dependence of the frequency on simulating steps, shown in Fig.\@\ref{changerate}. Moreover, the switching is more likely to happen \textit{with} a memory kernel, i.e., turnover rate decay slower in probability if the system has constraints in resource. It is also a clear result since a growing society (a society without a memory kernel) suffer less from inter-specific competition.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.47\textwidth]{pics/in_one_now_now.pdf}
	\caption{The change rate statistics with \textbf{(a)} and without \textbf{(b)} a memory kernel. The kernel keeps turning over more often. With same $\beta$'s, a kernel-based SYM's decay in turnover rate is smaller. These results validate our prediction that with finite resource, advantages are more likely to be kept.}
	\label{changerate}
\end{figure}

The last property of SYM is the fractality of urban envelop, stately, the length of urban edges vary with the used measurement. Inspired by multi-player interaction in fractal financial market\cite{PhysRevE.65.037106}, we interpret that fractal urban boundary is driven by the competition for land at cities' edges. In SYM, the uncertain competition for space lies in parameter $r$. A larger $r$ indicates larger randomness and brings an extra advantage for minor cities, resulting in a larger fractal dimension. We apply the box counting technique to calculate the fractal dimension of urban envelops, and receive an stable output of $d_f = 1.2\pm 0.05$ with $r = 0.5$, similar to empirical results\cite{batty1992form}. We also find larger $d_f$'s for greater $r$. These results validate our hypothesis that fractal edges coexist with spatial competition. Also, this result also confirms that SYM replicates an urban system.

% 这两段是新写的。
% In this letter, we have proposed a simple model, spatial preferential growth with finite seeds, to simulate the emergence of cities and reveal the scaling laws as well as how economical dilemma would lead to spatial transitions.

% This model leads a way in the adaptation of realistic conditions in statistical physical modeling, by regardless of the whole present population within the system, and considering only the active part of them. 
This \emph{Letter} concludes the urban system dynamics in only three key components, and presents fruitful results. The SYM leads a way in the adaptation of realistic conditions in statistical physical modeling, by regardless of the whole present population within the system, and considering only the active part of them. SYM explains existing properties, such as fractality, Zipf's, and Clark's law, where we have both analytical mean-field derivations and bias analysis. More importantly, SYM predicts regional trends in a probabilistic perspective. With the simplicity of SYM, we manage to investigate the future phase transition of urban development in great details, and explain dilemmas of the present stage of urbanization through the competitions for systematic resource and space. The assumptions of SYM are well-held if sufficient divergence of meta-population across the world is considered. Simulations of this model can be adjust to heterogeneous geographical circumstances by applying the growing rate on each cell to the product of inherent dynamic $m_{ij}\cdot \beta_2$ and the local characteristic $c_{ij}$ to better suit for realistic conditions.

The memory kernel mechanism leads to a straightforward corollary that the reproductivity drives population's spatial transitions, as only those who are recorded in the kernel are considered as active citizens that attract new-comers to his city. This result provides a bottom-up explanation for transition of urban centers with stochastic spatial shifts of cities' memorized people. It also tells that the economic growth is the basis of growth potentials. In reality, occasional events such as the discovery of new fossil fuel, or new technical revolutions, all lead to the growth of $N^*$. Under the circumstances of preferential attraction, if the size of the memory kernel cannot grow fast enough to match with population, the concentration of production will go far from tolerance. 

Taking the productive aspect together in the memory kernel reveals many other properties like the age structure. The stationary age can be calculated as the average time for a new city to emerge is $(\beta_2 N^* + \beta_1 k)^{-1}$, which equals to the average losing age of the whole kernel. This result gives an instruction of the length of workable age in a given social urban system.

% 不足
Although our results are not all analytically proved, we believe it is an essential step to strip out the power of urban dynamics. The model is non-commuting, but the community structure is naturally embedded. For further consideration, we can extend the model by adding links as the volume of exploration and preferential return between cities\cite{WANG2019121921}. The model can further be extended with multi-dimensional memory kernel, allowing one citizen to be introduced if different factors\cite{doi:10.1098/rsif.2019.0564} (i.e., the existing citizens in different dimension of kernel) agree to allow her in the system.
