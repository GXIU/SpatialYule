	abstract = {An important issue in the study of cities is defining a metropolitan area, because different definitions
	            affect conclusions regarding the statistical distribution of urban activity. A commonly employed method
	            of defining a metropolitan area is the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), based on rules attempting
	            to capture the notion of city as a functional economic region, and it is performed by using experience.
	            The construction of MSAs is a time-consuming process and is typically done only for a subset (a few
	            hundreds) of the most highly populated cities. Here, we introduce a method to designate metropolitan
	            areas, denoted {\textquotedblleft}City Clustering Algorithm{\textquotedblright} (CCA). The CCA is based
	            on spatial distributions of the population at a fine geographic scale, defining a city beyond the scope
	            of its administrative boundaries. We use the CCA to examine Gibrat{\textquoteright}s law of proportional
	            growth, which postulates that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities are constant,
	            independent of city size. We find that the mean growth rate of a cluster by utilizing the CCA exhibits
	            deviations from Gibrat{\textquoteright}s law, and that the standard deviation decreases as a power law
	            with respect to the city size. The CCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these
	            deviations, which are shown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in population
	            growth. These results have sociopolitical implications, for example, for the location of new economic
	            development in cities of varied size.},

	abstract = {Modern society depends on the flow of information over online social networks, and users of popular
	            platforms generate significant behavioral data about themselves and their social ties. However, it
	            remains unclear what fundamental limits exist when using these data to predict the activities and
	            interests of individuals, and to what accuracy such predictions can be made using an individual's social
	            ties. Here we show that 95{\%} of the potential predictive accuracy for an individual is achievable using
	            their social ties only, without requiring that individual's data. We use information theoretic tools to
	            estimate the predictive information within the writings of Twitter users, providing an upper bound on the
	            available predictive information that holds for any predictive or machine learning methods. As few as 8-9
	            of an individual's contacts are sufficient to obtain predictability comparable to that of the individual
	            alone. Distinct temporal and social effects are visible by measuring information flow along social ties,
	            allowing us to better study the dynamics of online activity. Our results have distinct privacy
	            implications: information is so strongly embedded in a social network that in principle one can profile
	            an individual from their available social ties even when the individual forgoes the platform completely.},

	            behavior of the stochastic model. It is shown in particular that, for some values of the parameters, some

	            finite kernel to model the effects of bounded memory. We characterize the properties of the model
	            combining analytical arguments with extensive numerical simulations. In particular, we analyze the
	            lifetime and popularity distributions by mapping the model dynamics to corresponding Markov chains and
	            branching processes, respectively. These distributions follow power-laws with well defined exponents that
	            are within the range of the empirical data reported in ecologies. Interestingly, by varying the
	            innovation rate, this simple out-of-equilibrium model exhibits many of the characteristics of a
	            continuous phase transition and, around the critical point, it generates time series with power-law
	            popularity, lifetime and inter-event time distributions, and non-trivial temporal correlations, such as a
	            bursty dynamics in analogy with the activity of solar flares. Our results suggest that an appropriate

	abstract = {Much effort has been devoted to understand how temporal network features and the choice of the source
	            node affect the prevalence of a diffusion process. In this work, we addressed the further question: node
	            pairs with what kind of local and temporal connection features tend to appear in a diffusion trajectory
	            or path, thus contribute to the actual information diffusion. We consider the Susceptible-Infected
	            spreading process with a given infection probability per contact on a large number of real-world temporal
	            networks. We illustrate how to construct the information diffusion backbone where the weight of each link
	            tells the probability that a node pair appears in a diffusion process starting from a random node. We
	            unravel how these backbones corresponding to different infection probabilities relate to each other and
	            point out the importance of two extreme backbones: the backbone with infection probability one and the
	            integrated network, between which other backbones vary. We find that the temporal node pair feature that

	            across all the empirical networks highlights that temporal information are crucial in determining a node
	            pair's role in a diffusion process. A node pair with many early contacts tends to appear in a diffusion
	            process. Our findings shed lights on the in-depth understanding and may inspire the control of

	abstract = {Two classes of scaling behaviours, namely the super-linear scaling of links or activities, and the
	            sub-linear scaling of area, diversity, or time elapsed with respect to size have been found to prevail in
	            the growth of complex networked systems. Despite some pioneering modelling approaches proposed for
	            specific systems, whether there exists some general mechanisms that account for the origins of such
	            scaling behaviours in different contexts, especially in socioeconomic systems, remains an open question.
	            We address this problem by introducing a geometric network model without free parameter, finding that
	            both super-linear and sub-linear scaling behaviours can be simultaneously reproduced and that the scaling
	            exponents are exclusively determined by the dimension of the Euclidean space in which the network is
	            embedded. We implement some realistic extensions to the basic model to offer more accurate predictions
	            for cities of various scaling behaviours and the Zipf distribution reported in the literature and
	            observed in our empirical studies. All of the empirical results can be precisely recovered by our model
	            with analytical predictions of all major properties. By virtue of these general findings concerning

	            pairs with what kind of local and temporal connection features tend to appear in a diffusion trajectory
	            or path, thus contribute to the actual information diffusion. We consider the Susceptible-Infected
	            spreading process with a given infection probability per contact on a large number of real-world temporal
	            networks. We illustrate how to construct the information diffusion backbone where the weight of each link

	            unravel how these backbones corresponding to different infection probabilities relate to each other and
	            point out the importance of two extreme backbones: the backbone with infection probability one and the

	abstract = {Two classes of scaling behaviours, namely the super-linear scaling of links or activities, and the
	            sub-linear scaling of area, diversity, or time elapsed with respect to size have been found to prevail in
	            the growth of complex networked systems. Despite some pioneering modelling approaches proposed for
	            specific systems, whether there exists some general mechanisms that account for the origins of such
	            scaling behaviours in different contexts, especially in socioeconomic systems, remains an open question.
	            We address this problem by introducing a geometric network model without free parameter, finding that
	            both super-linear and sub-linear scaling behaviours can be simultaneously reproduced and that the scaling
	            exponents are exclusively determined by the dimension of the Euclidean space in which the network is
	            embedded. We implement some realistic extensions to the basic model to offer more accurate predictions
	            for cities of various scaling behaviours and the Zipf distribution reported in the literature and
	            observed in our empirical studies. All of the empirical results can be precisely recovered by our model
	            with analytical predictions of all major properties. By virtue of these general findings concerning

	abstract = {Modern society depends on the flow of information over online social networks, and users of popular
	            platforms generate significant behavioral data about themselves and their social ties. However, it
	            remains unclear what fundamental limits exist when using these data to predict the activities and
	            interests of individuals, and to what accuracy such predictions can be made using an individual's social
	            ties. Here we show that 95{\%} of the potential predictive accuracy for an individual is achievable using
	            their social ties only, without requiring that individual's data. We use information theoretic tools to
	            estimate the predictive information within the writings of Twitter users, providing an upper bound on the
	            available predictive information that holds for any predictive or machine learning methods. As few as 8-9
	            of an individual's contacts are sufficient to obtain predictability comparable to that of the individual
	            alone. Distinct temporal and social effects are visible by measuring information flow along social ties,
	            allowing us to better study the dynamics of online activity. Our results have distinct privacy
	            implications: information is so strongly embedded in a social network that in principle one can profile
	            an individual from their available social ties even when the individual forgoes the platform completely.},

	            pairs with what kind of local and temporal connection features tend to appear in a diffusion trajectory
	            or path, thus contribute to the actual information diffusion. We consider the Susceptible-Infected
	            spreading process with a given infection probability per contact on a large number of real-world temporal
	            networks. We illustrate how to construct the information diffusion backbone where the weight of each link

	            sub-linear scaling of area, diversity, or time elapsed with respect to size have been found to prevail in
	            the growth of complex networked systems. Despite some pioneering modelling approaches proposed for
	            specific systems, whether there exists some general mechanisms that account for the origins of such
	            scaling behaviours in different contexts, especially in socioeconomic systems, remains an open question.
	            We address this problem by introducing a geometric network model without free parameter, finding that

	            two estimation methods—OLS and the Hill estimator. With either estimator, we reject Zipf's Law far more
	            often than we would expect based on random chance; for 53 out of 73 countries using OLS, and for 30 out
	            of 73 countries using the Hill estimator. The OLS estimates of the Pareto exponent are roughly normally
	            distributed, but those of the Hill estimator are bimodal. Variations in the value of the Pareto exponent
	            are better explained by political economy variables than by economic geography variables.",

	            scaling of individual cities over many time points and expects parallel superlinear growth trajectories
	            as cities{\textquoteright} populations grow. This prediction has not yet been rigorously tested. I use
	            geocoded microdata to approximate the city-size effect on per capita wage in 73 Swedish labor market
	            areas for 1990{\textendash}2012. The data support a superlinear scaling regime for all Swedish
	            agglomerations. Echoing the rich-get-richer process on the system level, however, trajectories of
	            superlinear growth are highly robust only for cities assuming dominant positions in the urban hierarchy.},
